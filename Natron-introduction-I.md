# Natron. An introduction I
*12-03-2023*

Natron is an open-source alternative to Nuke and After effects. It is widely used to design powerful visual effects and motion graphics. It works as a node-based editor. That means one can define nodes and link them to other nodes, creating, in that way, a multimodal network of multiple resources and frames happening in a linear time. **My interest in this software is designing interactive and animated data visualizations.** I am convinced that Natron is a great tool to represent urban flows and rhythms, and it could enrich the ethnographic representations of public places.  

## Generalities 

### Nodes
Everything in Natron is a node. Everything. So, it means we need to treat our external sources as nodes as well. But what does it mean? It means and proposes a model of working called *compositing* based on combining audiovisual resources from different sides into single audiovisual products to make them look like they are part of the same construction. Conceiving resources as nodes also means situating them as almost-finished elements whose final meaning will depend on the associations when they are participating. 

### Setup
Route to access the document setup: Display > Show Project Settings

## Interface
There are three main areas inside Natron: 
1.	**Viewer.** It is where one can see, arrange, and modify their composition visually. It also has the project's timeline at the bottom and a toolbar on the screen's left side. The [Toolbar](#toolbar) is the starting point to create nodes. 
2.	**Node graph.** A space where creating, connecting, and disconnecting nodes is possible. It offers an excellent general view of the project. 
3.	**Properties & Project settings** The available options in *properties* will depend on what element one is selecting. This is where one can modify the values of each element and node. *Project settings* is self-explanatory. There, one can adjust the generalities of the whole document. 

The panel properties will change every time one node is selected. It is there that one can modify the different values of the nodes and the composition itself.

## Toolbar
It comprises ten categories that group a vast number of node possibilities.
+ **Time.** A set of nodes that modify the time frame of the composition.
+ **Channel.** It changes and rearranges color channels and spaces.
+ **Color.** A bunch of nodes to correct, equalize, and improve color profiles.
+ **Filter.** This is one of the biggest collections of nodes. They add visual complexity to images and videos.    
+ **Keyer.** A set of resources to subtract mattes from a video to make them transparent. 
+ **Merge.** Those nodes are tools for mixing, switching, and dissolving other nodes. 
+ **Transform.** Different options to modify the size, shape, and position of videos and images,
+ **Views.** It offers various spaces from where to see our compositions.
+ **GMIC.** This compiles all the elements from the Gâ€™mic framework. A collection of interfaces and datasets. 
+ **Other** and **Extra.** Those two are a couple of subsets gathering a bunch of uncategorized nodes.
